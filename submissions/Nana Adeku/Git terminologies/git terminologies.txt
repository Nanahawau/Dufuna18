Git terminologies

1. Merge : Taking the changes from one branch and adding them into another (traditionally master) branch. These commits are usually first requested via pull request 
		before being merged by a project maintainer.

2. Pull request : If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to be reviewed to add to the master branch, that someone can put in a 
			pull request. Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. A pull happens when adding the changes to the master branch.

3. Master : The primary branch of all repositories. All committed and accepted changes should be on the master branch. You can work directly from the master branch,
		 or create other branches.

4. Push : Updates a remote branch with the commits made to the current branch. You are literally “pushing” your changes onto the remote.
